Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.

- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

<CodeBlock>
    ```javascript
    function cloneDeep(data, visited = new Map()) {
    if (!data || typeof data !== "object") {
        return data;
    }

    if (visited.has(data)) {
        return visited.get(data);
    }

    const res = Array.isArray(data) ? [] : {};
    visited.set(data, res);

    const keys = [...Object.keys(data), ...Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(data)];
    for (const key of keys) {
        res[key] = cloneDeep(data[key], visited);
    }

    return res;
    }

    console.log("polyfill tetsing of cloneDeep -", cloneDeep(inputObj));
    ```

</CodeBlock>

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
