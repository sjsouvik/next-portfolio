Hello everyone, in this article, we would be discussing:

- **Implicit binding**, **Explicit binding** in JavaScript
- the **call, apply and bind** methods in JavaScript and how they are different from each other.

These are very important concepts and are asked frequently in interviews. So, keep reading till the end.

## Implicit & Explicit binding

`this` keyword in JS generally points to the object that the function is a property of. In other words, we can also say `this` refers to the object that is being used to invoke the function.

```javascript
const souvik = {
  learning: true,
  status: "Learning",
  work: function () {
    console.log(`${this.status} Full Stack Web Dev!`);
  },
};

souvik.work(); //Learning Full Stack Web Dev!
```

In the example above, we can see that the `work()` method is being invoked using `souvik` object. This way of invoking a method using dot operator is known as **Implicit binding** where `this` refers to the object using which the method is invoked.

There are other ways as well to reuse the same method or, to invoke a method using other objects with the help of `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()` methods in JS where `this` keyword will point to the object that will be passed as an **argument** to the **call(), apply() and bind()** methods. This kind of invoking method is known as **Explicit binding**.

## What is the call() method?

Let's say, we have an object with some properties and functions.

```javascript
let learning = {
  technology: "JavaScript",
  printActivity: function () {
    console.log("Learning ", this.technology);
  },
};
```

`this` keyword in the object points to the `learning` object itself in the example. And if we just try to invoke the `printActivity()` function, it would print `Learning JavaScript`. Simple! right?

```javascript
learning.printActivity(); //Learning JavaScript
```

Now, what if we want to print the same for other learning activities? One solution that comes to our mind easily, is to create a new object for that and call the method just like we did in the 1st example.

```javascript
let learningSomethingNew = {
  technology: "React",
  printActivity: function () {
    console.log("Learning ", this.technology);
  },
};
```

The other and best solution for this scenario is to use the `call()` method.

```javascript
let learningSomethingNew = {
  technology: "React",
};
learning.printActivity.call(learningSomethingNew); //Learning React
```

In this way, we could reuse the `printActivity` function for different objects. That's why it's recommended to write a function separately without making it a part of an object if it could be used in multiple scenarios.

```javascript
let learning = {
  technology: "JavaScript",
};

let learningSomethingNew = {
  technology: "React",
};

function printActivity() {
  console.log("Learning ", this.technology);
}

printActivity.call(learning); //Learning JavaScript
printActivity.call(learningSomethingNew); //Learning React
```

We might need to pass some extra argument to the function as well. We can do that too.

```javascript
function printActivity(months, days) {
  console.log(
    "Learning " + this.technology + "since " + months + " and " + days
  );
}

printActivity.call(learning, 3, 15); //Learning JavaScript since 3 months and 15 days
printActivity.call(learningSomethingNew, 2, 15); //Learning React since 2 months and 15 days
```

## What is the apply() method?

The `apply()` method is similar to the `call()` method. The only difference is that apply method takes arguments as an array whereas the call method takes arguments separately.

```javascript
function printActivity(months, days) {
  console.log(
    "Learning " + this.technology + "since " + months + " and " + days
  );
}

printActivity.apply(learning, [3, 15]); //Learning JavaScript since 3 months and 15 days
printActivity.apply(learningSomethingNew, [2, 15]); //Learning React since 2 months and 15 days
```

## What is the bind() method?

The `bind()` method doesn't invoke the function like `call()` and `apply()`, instead it returns a copy of the function where the `this` keyword will point to the object that is passed as an argument.

```javascript
let learning = {
  technology: "JavaScript",
};

function printActivity() {
  console.log("Learning ", this.technology);
}

let copyOfTheFunction = printActivity.bind(learning);
copyOfTheFunction(); //Learning JavaScript
```
