excerpt: "Anything iterable is an object which will have the `Symbol.iterator` method in it and when we try to iterate it or want it to behave like an iterable(using `for...of` loop), the `Symbol.iterator` method would be invoked which would return an object (iterator). The returned object would have the `next` method in it, which would produce an object with the value and status of the iteration (using _boolean_) - whether any other value is present or not to be iterated."

I learned about _Iterators and Generators in JavaScript_ while solving a problem. So, we will be discussing these concepts here and trying to understand the concepts using the same problem that I encountered.

Before looking at the problem and understanding how to solve it, let's start with some theory...

### Iterators

Iterables are objects which could be iterated using the `for...of` loop.

Anything iterable is an object which will have the `Symbol.iterator` method in it and when we try to iterate it or want it to behave like an iterable(using `for...of` loop), the `Symbol.iterator` method would be invoked which would return an object (iterator). The returned object would have the `next` method in it, which would produce an object with the value and status of the iteration (using _boolean_) - whether any other value is present or not to be iterated.

A method(`Symbol.iterator`) returning an object(iterator) which has another method(`next`) in it 🤔 - complicated, right?

Let's understand the above statements better by solving the problem using iterators now.

The problem:

```
Q. Can you create a range(from, to) that makes the following work?

for (let num of range(1, 4)) {
  console.log(num)
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

This is a simple one, could you think of more fancy approaches other than for-loop?
```

The simplest solution for the above problem would be as follows:

```javascript
function range(from, to) {
  const arr = [];

  for (let i = from; i <= to; i++) {
    arr.push(i);
  }

  return arr;
}
```

> Look at the problem statement again, we are not required to return an array, but something iterable would be fine as we'll be using the `for...of` loop.

Now, we would be writing the `range` function which would take 2 numbers as arguments and return an iterable.

```javascript
// to make range() iterable
function range(from, to) {
  return {
    [Symbol.iterator]: function () {
      // This returned object is known as the "iterator object" in the case of iterators and the "generator object" in the case of generators.
      return {
        from,
        to,

        next: function () {
          if (this.from <= this.to) {
            return { value: this.from++, done: false };
          } else {
            return { done: true };
          }
        },
      };
    },
  };
}

for (const item of range(1, 4)) {
  console.log(item);
}
```

In the above code, whenever we try to iterate using the `for...of` loop,

- it calls the `Symbol.iterator` method once for the 1st time and gets the _iterator_ object.

- Next time onwards `for...of` uses the `next` method to get the next value while iterating.

> Don't confuse arrays with the iterables. Iterables are objects which implement the `Symbol.iterator` method in it. Arrays and strings have built-in implementation of `Symbol.iterator` along with many other methods and properties, not necessarily other iterables would have the same.

### Generators

The generator function returns an object known as the "generator object" and has the `next` method in it.

Example:

```javascript
function* generatorExample() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
}

const generatorObject = generatorExample();
console.log(generatorObject.next()); // {value: 1, done: false};
console.log(generatorObject.next()); // {value: 2, done: false};
console.log(generatorObject.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true};
```

When the `next` method is called, it executes the function till the 1st yield, then pause the execution and returns an object with 2 properties:

- value: yielded value.
- done: boolean, which says whether the function execution is finished or not.

> The generator functions can be identified by the `*` in function declaration, right after the `function` keyword(function`*`) or before the function name(function `*`name) without any space.

The same problem mentioned above could be solved using Generator functions quite easily as follows:

```javascript
function range(from, to) {
  return {
    [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
      for (let i = from; i <= to; i++) {
        yield i;
      }
    },
  };
}

for (const item of range(1, 4)) {
  console.log(item);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

The `range` function is still returning an object which has the `Symbol.iterator` method in it. But the difference is the `Symbol.iterator` is holding a generator function now. And as we know, the generator function returns the generator object with the `next` method in itself - which we had to implement explicitly for iterators.

> Generators are also iterable.

we can use the `for...of` loop with generators then.

```javascript
function* generatorExample() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
}

const generatorObject = generatorExample();

for (const item of generatorObject) {
  console.log(item);
}
// 1
// 2
```

Since a generator is also iterable, the solution can be simplified more as we don't have to implement the `Symbol.iterator` method explicitly.

```javascript
function* range(from, to) {
  for (let i = from; i <= to; i++) {
    yield i;
  }
}

for (const item of range(1, 4)) {
  console.log(item);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

That's all for now 😀. Thanks for reading till now🙏.
